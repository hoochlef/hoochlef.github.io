I am a [software developer](https://github.com/hoochlef) driven by utility; I build applications to solve problems I encounter in daily life. My approach is adaptive, I learn the necessary tools on the spot.

I also [write](https://hoochlef.github.io/blog/) short-to-mid length essays about tech, life, and whatever I currently find interesting.

If what I do resonates with you [reach out](mailto:amine.hochlef@proton.me).
