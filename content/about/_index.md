Hello, web-surfer! I'm Amine, a pragmatic software developer who builds applications mostly with Python.

Apart from code, I enjoy playing and trying different kinds of sports, watching movies and cooking new things.

Usually right here there is even more information about me. I’ll probably add it back in a future iteration of this website.

If any of this resonates with you and you're ambitious like me, get in touch. Life's short—make things happen.
