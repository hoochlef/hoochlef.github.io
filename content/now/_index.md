I'm currently

> building medtrack: a web app that tells you all the relevant information about your medication just by uploading a picture of it. (there will be more information about the app in the future iterations, and of course the repo hosted on GitHub of the first running demo).

I earned my Bachelor’s in Computer Science in July 2025.

> since then, I’ve been working on a mix of projects—mostly web projects to solve real-life problems I run into. My current focus is on open-source work, blending machine learning with fast, minimalist software.
