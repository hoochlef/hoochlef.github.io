Welcome to my corner of the internet — my second blog in about six months and a fresh start.

My previous blog became weighed down with clutter and distractions, which made it hard to focus on writing. This time, I’m going minimalist: a clean, fast site powered by Zola, designed to keep things simple and clear.

Here, I’ll share thoughts, experiments, and lessons from my journey in tech — covering Python, machine learning, open-source, and even reflections on digital detox and life beyond screens.

No noise, just ideas. Stay curious.
